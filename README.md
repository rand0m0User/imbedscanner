*you must have java added to your PATH (installed properly) for it to work*
you may hardcode a specific java version in the batch file, but this isn't very performance dependent as you can just let it run overnight

to use, simply copy "imbedscanner.jar" and "scan.bat" to the folder you wish to scan, this may be at the base of your image collection folder, i.e "D:\images" and run "scan.bat"
to scan a single file, run "java -jar "imbedscanner.jar" "D:/path/to/your/image.png"" in command prompt

some example images are included, various jpeg compresed images, (not resaved a billion times) and an imbeded image (NOT 'P)
